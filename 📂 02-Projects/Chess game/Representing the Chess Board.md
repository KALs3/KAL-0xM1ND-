#### **Questions to Think About:**

1. **What data structure would be best for storing the board?**
    
    - Should it be a 2D array, a list of lists, or something else?
2. **How should we represent empty squares and pieces on the board?**
    
    - Should empty spaces be `null`, `"."`, or some other symbol?
    - How will we distinguish different piece types (pawn, rook, etc.)?
3. **How should we initialize the board?**
    
    - Where do pawns go?
    - Where do the major pieces (king, queen, etc.) go?
