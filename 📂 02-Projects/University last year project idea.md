project one is capstone project two is thesis project three is combination but with machine learning implemention or IoT projects are should be health care or similar as long as it relates to UN Sustainable Development related, i should create research paper to it, software documentation paper, software architecture diagrams all kinds of stuff, and detailed intrinsic details of how you created that project. Either Web or mobile or combination. Second is, doing a video of myself explain the project, tech stack being used, why these tech stack, and basic marketing the project similar to a pitch deck video. Third is find a expert to judge my personal project and what tweaks of features should be improved, or redundant.

This comment outlines a structured approach to project development for junior developers, likely in an academic or professional setting where projects are evaluated rigorously. Here’s a breakdown of what each part means:

### **1. Types of Projects**

- **Project One (Capstone Project):**
    
    - A capstone project is typically a final-year or major project that demonstrates everything you've learned in your coursework.
    - It is practical and applied, meaning you create a fully functional application with complete documentation.
    - Example: A mobile or web-based patient management system for a hospital.
- **Project Two (Thesis):**
    
    - A thesis is more research-focused, often involving theoretical exploration or innovative problem-solving.
    - It may include software development but emphasizes novel ideas or improvements in technology.
    - Example: A study on how blockchain can improve medical record security.
- **Project Three (Combination with ML or IoT):**
    
    - A combination of practical development (capstone) and research (thesis) but with an additional implementation of advanced technologies like **Machine Learning (ML)** or **Internet of Things (IoT)**.
    - Example: A smart health monitoring system that collects patient data (IoT) and predicts health conditions using AI (ML).

### **2. Project Domain - UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**

- Your projects should be related to major global challenges, like **healthcare, education, sustainability, or social welfare**, aligning with the **United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs)**.
- Example SDG-related projects:
    - A mobile app for mental health awareness (SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being).
    - A web app for remote learning in rural areas (SDG 4: Quality Education).

### **3. Documentation Requirements**

- You are expected to **document your project thoroughly**, including:
    - **Research Paper:** A formal write-up explaining the problem, the research behind your solution, and how it contributes to SDGs.
    - **Software Documentation:** Instructions, technical specifications, and user manuals.
    - **Software Architecture Diagrams:** System flow, database design, API structures, etc.
    - **Technical Implementation Details:** How you built it, challenges faced, and optimizations.

### **4. Project Presentation (Pitch Video)**

- Create a video where you:
    - Explain your project clearly.
    - Justify why you chose specific **technologies** (e.g., Java for backend, React for frontend, Firebase for database).
    - Market your project like a **startup pitch** (who would use it and why it’s valuable).

### **5. Expert Review and Feedback**

- Find an industry expert (developer, professor, or mentor) to **evaluate** your project.
- Get feedback on:
    - Feature improvements.
    - Redundant or unnecessary features.
    - Optimization suggestions.

This approach ensures your project is not only **technically sound** but also **practically relevant** and well-documented, making it a strong portfolio piece for future job applications.
