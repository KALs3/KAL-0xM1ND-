An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a
program, that stops the normal flow of the program's instructions.

An Exception describes errors caused by your program and external
circumstances. These errors can be caught and handled by your
program.


Examples of serious errors that could occur within a Java program are as follows:
❑ a program tries to read past the end of a data file;
❑ a program cannot find a specified input file;
❑ a program tries to connect to a website using an invalid address;
❑ a program runs out of memory;
❑ a method tries to access an array element whose index is larger than the
upper limit of the array;
❑ an overflow condition occurs when the result of some arithmetic operation
exceeds the limit for the primitive data types involved;
❑ a program expecting to read a file of integers finds a string value in the file;
❑ a method expecting an object reference encounters a null reference
instead.
